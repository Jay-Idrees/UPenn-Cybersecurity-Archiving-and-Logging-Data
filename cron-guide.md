### 01. Welcome and Overview

In the previous class, we archived data, scheduled data backups, and monitored log files. Now we will spend today learning methods to automate our work in an effort to become more efficient.

- Previously, we protected system stability by using `tar` to list and extract data, and to manually create backups that we can use to restore the system to an earlier state.

- Today, you will learn how to write scripts and use a tool called `cron` to schedule regular automation for many of the tasks performed last class.

Many of these steps must be performed regularly to remain effective. For example, backups are only useful if they're current, and health checks are only informative if they're real-time.

System administrators address this need for constant performance by using **automation**. Automation is the process of setting tasks to execute on their own. It takes two main forms:

- **Scripts** are files that contain multiple commands. All these commands can be executed by simply calling the script name. You will touch on this today and take a deeper dive into scripting next week.

- **Scheduled jobs** allow you to run commands or scripts at specific, designated times. A scheduled job is a command or script that the system runs at a specific time interval. These will be the focus of today's lesson.

System administrators often use these tools together in the following work flow:

- **Fix an issue.** For example, making a list of all users with old passwords, then forcing those users to update their credentials.

- **Write a script to solve the issue automatically.** For example, writing the script `find_stale_users.sh`, containing the commands you ran to fix the password update issue.

- **Use `cron` to run the script and email the results regularly.** For example, using `cron` to run `find_stale_users.sh` every Saturday at noon.

Sysadmins tend to grow and scale their solutions by using scripts and scheduling to automate anything they must do more than once.



### 02.  Overview of `cron` 

In this section, we'll introduce `cron`. Consider the following scenario:

- Before leaving the office for the day, you spend ten minutes deleting your cache, emptying the trash bin, and backing up your documents folder.

- You also spend one hour per day installing software updates.

Rather than spending time repeatably completing these tasks, we can automate them using a tool called **cron jobs**:

 - User-level cron jobs can automate the process of deleting cache, emptying trash and backing up documents.

 - System-level cron jobs can automate daily updates.

A **cron job** as a script or command designated to run at regular or periodic, predetermined intervals. They can be used for both user-level or system-level tasks.

The _cron_ in _cron job_ refers to a **system daemon** that keeps track of when to run scheduled tasks.

- A daemon is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user.

- `cron`, (named after Kronos, the Greek god of time), is a robust tasks scheduler that allows us to schedule scripts or commands to run on a regular basis.

- `cron` is most suitable for scheduling repetitive tasks.

Systems often start daemons at boot time. Daemons will then respond to network requests, hardware activity, or other programs by performing some task.

- Rather than respond to network requests or hardware activity, the `cron` daemon is initiated at designated time intervals.

`cron` tasks are scheduled in a file called **crontab**, or **cron table**.

- crontab stores lists of tasks and other instructions for the `cron` daemon to execute.

Users have their own individual crontab files, which are private to them.

- Tasks scheduled by a user are run under the user's current privilege level.

- All user tasks on the system are essentially sandboxed processes that affect only the local user and not the overall system.

Each user, including `root`, can have a `cron` file.

- These files don't exist by default, but can be created in the `/var/spool/cron` directory using the `crontab -e` command, which is also used to edit a `cron` file.

- One should never edit `cron` files directly in the `/var/spool/cron` directory. This will corrupt and essentially break the `cron` service by introducing bugs into the system. The preferred method is to edit crontab files only.

The `cron` daemon must be running at all times in order to check the crontab at one minute intervals. This one minute interval is the default set by the system. It's imperative that administrators can ensure that `cron` service is up and running with no conflicts.

Next, we'll take a look at `cron` and crontab rules on the command line.

- Although upon first glance, a crontab rule can be intimidating, it is a concept that can be relatively easy to learn with some practice.

In the upcoming walkthrough, we'll focus on the following:

- General `cron` command line syntax.
- Listing the contents of the crontab with `crontab -l`.
- Editing a crontab with `crontab -e`.

#### Intro to `cron` Syntax Walkthrough

Begin by checking if the `cron` service is up and running.

  - Launch a terminal in your VM and verify that `cron` is up by running `systemctl status cron`.

  - Review the excerpt of the output below and emphasize the importance of the following line: `Active: active (running) since Wed 2019-08-28 22:03:44 PDT; 5 days ago`.

    ```bash
    ● cron.service - Regular background program processing daemon
    Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/cron.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
    Active: active (running) since Wed 2019-08-28 22:03:44 PDT; 5 days ago
        Docs: man:cron(8)
    Main PID: 884 (cron)
        Tasks: 1 (limit: 2318)
    CGroup: /system.slice/cron.service
            └─884 /usr/sbin/cron -fk
    ```

  - The status `active` verifies that `cron` is running as expected. It's also important to take note how long the `cron` service has been up and running, which may be helpful during troubleshooting.

    - **Running** = running currently
    - **Active** = will run on startup

Now, we'll focus on two crontab commands:

  - `crontab -l`, which lists the contents of a crontab.

  - `crontab -e`, which allows you to edit a crontab, and also checks for syntax errors upon saving.

| :warning: Head's Up :warning: |
|:-:|
| When editing their crontab, you may not be able to save the settings properly, especially if you are using a local Windows machine. If so, check to make sure that the file is not saving in DOS mode. To do this, press `alt-M` when saving a file in nano. |

First, we will list the contents of a crontab using `crontab -l`.

  - Run the following command:

    `crontab -l`

  - Output should look similar to output below:

      ```bash
      # Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
      #
      # Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
      # indicating with different fields when the task will be run
      # and what command to run for the task.
      #
      # To define the time you can provide concrete values for
      # minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
      # and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').#
      # Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
      # daemon's notion of time and timezones.
      #
      # Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
      # email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
      #
      # For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
      # at 5 a.m every week with:
      #
      #
      # For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
      #
      # m h  dom mon dow   command
      ```

  - This is the default configuration of a crontab:

    - This crontab contains comments, but no actual jobs.

    - However, note the small example of crontab syntax at the bottom: `m h  dom mon dow   command`.

- These abbreviations respectively stand for _minute_, _hour_, _day of month_, _month of year_, and _day of week_. The `command` simply refers to the command to execute.

Now we will take this time to review cron job syntax and verify whether our syntax is correct.

![Crontab Syntax](Images/crontab-execute-cron.png)

Using the above example, note that each value is specified with a number from the following ranges:

- Minutes are specified with 0-59.

- Hours are specified with 0-23, with 0 being midnight.

- Day of month is specified with 0-31, or however many days are in that month.

- Month of year is specified with 1-12, with 1 being January.

- Day of week is specified with 0-7, with 0 and 7 being Sunday, 1 being Monday, and so forth.

   - Some systems allow you to use three-letter abbreviations as well, such as `SAT` or `MON`. When in doubt, use numbers, which are universally understood.

- In a crontab, the `*` character means "every." For example, `*` in the day value means "every day."

Let's look at the following example:

  `0 23 * * 6     rm ~/Downloads/*`

- This job removes all files in the `~/Downloads` directory at 11pm, every Saturday, every month.

- This job is scheduled to run:

  - `0`: Minute

  - `23`: At 11 p.m.

  - `*`: Day of Month

  - `*`: Month of Year

  - `6`: Day of week

There are several tools we can use to check their syntax as they write cron jobs.

- One popular tool for **creating** crontabs is [Crontab Generator](https://crontab-generator.org), which translates cron jobs into plain English.

  - Return to your host machine and navigate to https://crontab-generator.org in a browser.

  - Use the following settings for this example: `0 6 * * 1-5`.

  - Point out that this translates to **at 6AM sharp, every week, every month, (Mon - Fri)**.

- **Note:** Another popular crontab generation tool that's great for **reverse engineering crontab records** is [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru), which is great at translating existing cron jobs into plain English.

#### Crontab Generator Demo

- First, select your inputs, then input the commands to be executed in the **Command To Execute** box.

  ![Inputs](Images/12.png)

- Second, click on **Generate Crontab Line**.

  ![Inputs](Images/13.png)

- Lastly, **copy** the newly generated cron job and **Paste** it into your crontab file.

  ![Inputs](Images/11.png)

- Done! This and other such tools are extremely popular amongst sysadmins, and are in no way considered "cheating." Think of this as another tool in your toolbox.

Next, we will dive into editing the crontab and inserting our own custom cron jobs.

- Return to the terminal in your VM and open your crontab:

  - Run `crontab -e`.

  - **Note**: This may prompt you to select a text editor. You should be using Nano as the text editor.

- Add the job mentioned above to the bottom of the crontab file:

  - `0 6 * * 1-5     rm ~/Downloads/*`

- Before saving the file, note that crontab automatically checks for syntax errors when you close it.

- Intentionally introduce an error by writing: `0 0 0 6 * * 1-5    rm ~/Downloads/*`. Attempt to save the file. Note that crontab refuses and reports an error.

  ```bash
  crontab: installing new crontab
  "/tmp/crontab.j2THN1/crontab":22: bad day-of-month
  errors in crontab file, cannot install.
  Do you want to retry the same edit? (y/n)
  ```

- Correct the syntax error by entering `y`, removing the two leading `0 0`, and saving the file.

Remember that this creates a crontab for the `instructor` user in `/var/spool/cron/crontabs`.

- Run the following commands:

  - `sudo ls /var/spool/cron/crontabs` to show:

    ```bash
      instructor  jane  root	sysadmin
    ```

- In the output above, the `instructor` crontab file belongs to a user, `instructor`.

- We'll look at the contents of the `instructor` crontab file. Then run:

  - `sudo tail /var/spool/cron/crontabs/instructor` to show:

    ```bash
    # 
    # For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
    # at 5 a.m every week with:
    # 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
    # 
    # For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
    # 
    # m h  dom mon dow   command

    0 6 * * 1-5    rm ~/Downloads/*
    ```

- In the above output, we see the line at the bottom of the file that is a scheduled active task `rm ~/Downloads/*`. This task is scheduled to remove all files located in the `Downloads` folder, at 6am sharp, every week, every month, (Mon-Fri).

Now, we will discuss the `root` crontab and the differences between the `root` and `user` crontabs.

- Cron jobs run under the same permissions as the user who creates it. Therefore, a cron job created by user `root` runs with root privileges.

- This introduces security risks that can potentially allow anyone capable of performing privilege escalation to add a malicious cron job to the `root` crontab, thus executing commands with root privileges.

  - There are a large number of risks associated with using `cron` with root privileges. We will address these risks in our last section of the lesson.

  - Best practice is to avoid using the `root` crontab at all. However, it is important to understand that it exists and how to inspect it.

- Inspecting the `root` crontab for unauthorized or malicious entries is a critical step for ensuring the integrity of any system.

One of the differences between a `root` and `user` crontab is how they are accessed and edited. To access and edit `root`, we use `sudo`.

- Access and edit `root` crontab by running:

  - `sudo crontab -l` and entering your password.

The root crontab is an exact replica of a user version, with the exception of the privilege level at which it runs and the directory where it is located.

- Also, the root crontab differs from user crontabs in that it is formatted differently, located in a different folder, and runs with root privileges.

- The `root` crontab is an exact replica of a user version, with the exception of the privilege level at which it runs and the directory where it is located.

- The command, `sudo crontab -l`, says: run `crontab -l` as the `root` user.

  - Since `crontab -l` displays the crontab under the privileges of the user who runs it, this displays the `root` crontab, even if you are `sysadmin`, a non-`root` user.

### 05. Introduction to Scripts

`cron` is most useful for managing single function tasks, such as backing up the `/home` directory, as opposed to performing multiple tasks, such as backing up several users' home directories: for example, backing up `/home/user1`, `/home/user2`, etc.

Instead of running several lines of code every day using `cron`, we can use scripting to perform all of our functions at once, and run the script once per day. The benefits of scripting becomes clear under these circumstances very quickly.

#### Writing a Script Demonstration

Launch a terminal session in Ubuntu, make sure you're working out of `/home/instructor/Documents`, then create and move into a new directory called `custom_scripts`

- Run: `cd ~/Documents`

- Run: `mkdir custom_scripts`

- Run: `cd custom_scripts`

Create a new script called `cleanup_downloads.sh` by running the following command in terminal:

- `nano cleanup_downloads.sh`

For the first line of your script, write: `#!/bin/bash`.

  - `#!` is called a **shebang**. It tells the shell that this file is a script that should be executed by bash.
  -  `/bin/bash` is the absolute path to the bash interpreter.
  - The shebang line specifies which interpreter to use when writing scripts.
  - For shells other than bash, or in different languages, the shebang line would indicate a different shell or language.
  - For example: for perl `#!/bin/perl`; for zcash `#!/bin/zsh`; for tcash `#!/bin/tsh`; for kash `#!/bin/ksh`

This lesson, we will focus exclusively on the bash shell since it's the most-used shell today.

Next, add the commands from the crontab example above to the script, exactly as you wrote them in the crontab:

  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash

  mv ~/Downloads/doctors*.docx /usr/share/doctors
  mv ~/Downloads/patients*.txt /usr/share/patients
  mv ~/Downloads/treatments*.pdf /usr/share/treatments
  ```

- This file now contains the same commands as your crontab but without the dates and times.

Save (`CTRL+X` if using `nano`) the file and perform a `ls long-listing` to emphasize that the script has been created.

- `ls -l`

  ```bash
  -rw-rw-r-- 1 instructor instructor   17 Aug  3 14:16 cleanup_downloads.sh
  ```

- The file permissions for this script do not contain an `x`.

- Scripts are meant to be run, or _executed_, and the execute bit is required for such files.

Set the execute bit by running the following command:

- `chmod +x cleanup_downloads.sh`

Then, rerun the long-listing to emphasize that the `x` bit is now present.

- `ls -l`

  ```bash
  -rwxrwxr-x 1 instructor instructor   17 Aug  3 14:16 cleanup_downloads.sh
  ```

Now, we can use `cron` to schedule execution of this script, rather than each individual command.

- To do this, first test the script for bugs, then update the crontab to use the script.

To test this script, we'll create some files that should move from `~/Downloads` into the appropriate subdirectories in `~/Documents`.

Move to `~/Downloads` and create several dummy files:

- `cd ~/Downloads`
- `touch treatments1.pdf treatments2.pdf`
- `touch doctors10.docx doctors11.docx`
- `touch patients20.txt patients44.txt`

Next, move back to the directory containing your script and run it:

  - `cd ~/Documents/custom_scripts`
  - `sudo ./cleanup_downloads.sh`

`./cleanup_downloads.sh` means _run the executable file `cleanup_downloads.sh` in the current directory (`.`)_. This syntax would not work if the `x` bit had not been set with `chmod`.

Test that the script worked as expected by inspecting your `~/Downloads` directory by running:

  - `ls ~/Downloads` to show the files have been moved

We should see them in the `/usr/share` directories and run:

  - `ls /usr/share/treatments` to show:

    ```bash
    treatments1.pdf  treatments2.pdf
    ```

  - `ls /usr/share/doctors` to show:

    ```bash
    doctors10.docx  doctors11.docx
    ```

  - `ls /usr/share/patients` to show:

    ```bash
    patients20.txt  patients44.txt
    ```

Since this verifies that the script behaves as expected, we can now update our crontab to use it.

Open your crontab for editing with: 

- `crontab -e`.

Add a line that runs the script every day at 6 p.m.:

  ```bash
  0 18 * * *     ~/Documents/custom_scripts/cleanup_downloads.sh
  ```

- Save the crontab and note that this will do the same job as before, but all of the cleanup tasks are now grouped into a single script called `cleanup_downloads.sh`.

You'll often see shell scripts saved without extensions. If a script contains a shebang line, bash doesn't need the file extension, so it is common practice to not include it.

Rename your script by running: 

- `mv ~/Documents/custom_scripts/cleanup_downloads.sh ~/Documents/custom_scripts/cleanup_downloads`

Be sure to also update your crontab. Update the line you added to:

```bash
0 18 * * *     ~/Documents/custom_scripts/cleanup_downloads
```

- We've now transformed multiple jobs that used single lines of commands into one script that executes all of the jobs.  

#### Walkthrough Wrap Up

In this walkthrough, we:

- Saved several commands into a single script, called `~/Documents/custom_scripts/cleanup_downloads`.
- Verified that this script behaves as expected.
- Updated our crontab to run the script instead of the three separate commands.

Using scripts allows us to complete complex tasks, such as creating backups or cleaning up multiple directories, through the execution of a single script. This results in cleaner crontabs with fewer lines of code, and the ability to schedule complex jobs that cannot be expressed by a single command.

### 07. Review Introduction to Scripts Review 

- [Solution Guide: Introduction to Scripts](./Activities/06_Introduction_to_Scripts/Solved/README.md)

### 08.  Scheduling Backups, Cleanups, and Security Checks


We'll begin by scheduling jobs for the scripts that we wrote in the previous exercise, using `cron` for regular execution.

User crontabs are useful for scheduling personal jobs, but not for system-level maintenance tasks.

- Crontabs belong to individual users and are designed to be run with the same permissions as the user.

- Therefore, they are typically unable to modify the system as a whole as they don't have root privileges.

We will use a different tool in this task: **system-wide `cron` directories**.

It’s important to understand the differences between system-wide cron directories and user crontabs:


-	System-wide cron directories are cron jobs that run with root privileges.


-	User crontabs are cron jobs under the privilege level of the user.

The system-wide `cron` directories are located:

- `/etc/cron.d`

- `/etc/cron.daily`

- `/etc/cron.weekly`

- `/etc/cron.monthly`

Each directory contains several scripts, which are run at dedicated time intervals.

- For example, any script placed in `/etc/cron.weekly` will run once per week.

The `/etc/cron.d` directory is used to store scripts that administrators run at custom times.
- Never edit `cron.d` directly. This has the potential to break `cron`.

This makes scheduling daily, weekly, and monthly jobs as easy as writing a script and putting it in the corresponding directory.

#### Single Line Scripts

Administrators often write scripts containing a single line of code and put them in these directories. Even though single commands can easily be run through the crontab, placing them in scripts and managing them through the system-wide `cron` directories makes them much easier to manage.

Launch a terminal in your Ubuntu VM. Navigate to `/etc/` and display the contents of the `daily` directory:

- `cd /etc`

- `ls cron.daily`

  ```bash
  00logwatch  apport      bsdmainutils      logrotate  passwd              ubuntu-advantage-tools
  0anacron    apt-compat  cracklib-runtime  man-db     popularity-contest  update-notifier-common
  apache2     aptitude    dpkg              mlocate    samba
  ```

We don't need to be familiar with every script in this directory, but the following are noteworthy:

- `0anacron` is used by a tool called `anacron` to run jobs that are overdue. `anacron` is out of the scope of this lesson, as it does not always integrate well with `cron`, but it is a common tool.

- `apt-compat` and `dpkg` keep the machine's list of packages up-to-date. This ensures the machine always installs the most recent version of software and knows when it's time to run upgrades.

- `update-notifier-common` lets you know when a system update is available.

- `man-db` ensures that man pages are up-to-date.

- `logrotate` helps make long log files easy for administrators to manage and review. We will learn about the `logrotate` tool in detail in the upcoming logging lesson.

Next, list the contents of the `cron.weekly` and `cron.monthly` directories:

- `ls cron.weekly`

  ```bash
  0anacron man-db update-notifier-common
  ```

- `ls cron.monthly`

  ```bash
  0anacron
  ```

There are fewer jobs in these directories.

- The `man-db` and `update-notifier-common` scripts are the same as the ones in `cron.daily`.

- They're included in `cron.weekly` for redundancy, to ensure they run.

Unlike user crontabs, `cron` executes scripts in the system-wide `cron` directories as `root`.

- This means it has full rights to perform any maintenance and administrative task, such as installing and upgrading software packages.

- The fact that `cron` runs jobs as `root` makes it a common target for attackers to achieve privilege escalation.

While there exists a system-wide crontab file, it's rarely modified directly.

- By default, the system-wide crontab file contains instructions to read and execute commands contained within the system-wide `cron` directories.

- It's best to not modify this file unless it is absolutely necessary.

Display the system crontab by running the command and displaying the following output:

- `less /etc/crontab`

  ```bash
  # /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
  # Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
  # command to install the new version when you edit this file
  # and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
  # that none of the other crontabs do.

  SHELL=/bin/sh
  PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

  # m h dom mon dow user  command
  17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
  25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
  47 6    * * 7   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
  52 6    1 * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )
  #
  ```

The lines at the bottom of this file are responsible for running scripts at the desired intervals with `root` privileges, i.e., daily, weekly, monthly.

The next exercise will give you an opportunity to use the system-wide `cron` directories to schedule the scripts they wrote in the previous exercise. In addition, you'll write new scripts to perform regular security scans with `lynis`, which will be demonstrated next.

#### Lynis Scanner

**Lynis** is a security scanner used to scan a machine for vulnerabilities. It generates and saves a report of its findings for administrators to review.

Lynis offers numerous scan types. Today, we'll experiment with a few different ones. You'll review the output in more detail in the upcoming logging lesson.

Launch a terminal in your VM and run: 

- `sudo lynis show help`.

  ```bash
  Lynis 2.6.2 - Help
  ==========================

  Commands:
  audit
  configure
  show
  update
  upload-only

  Use 'lynis show help <command>' to see details
  ```

One of the available commands is `audit`.

- This command can be used to audit the entire system.

- You will use man pages to learn how to schedule weekly full-system audits in the next exercise.

In addition to a full system audits, Lynis has the capability to can scan specific parts on the system. This takes less time than a full system scan and can be performed on a more frequent basis because it uses fewer resources.

Display the specific scans Lynis offers by running: 

- `sudo lynis show groups`.

  ```bash
  accounting
  authentication
  banners
  boot_services
  containers
  crypto
  ```

You can run specific scans with the command `sudo lynis audit --test-group <test group>`. You will use this flag to schedule daily scans in the upcoming exercise.
